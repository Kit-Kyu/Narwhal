Volume 2: Losing a Loss
(Post-surgery arc, where memory fades but love tries to stay.)

"Where Am I?"
— Nerthus wakes up after surgery. The world is familiar. But the man smiling at her feels like a stranger.

"He Says He's My Husband"
— Skadii gently reintroduces himself. Nerthus stares, unsure whether to believe... or panic.

"A List of Strangers"
— Skadii shows her old journals and glasswork. Nothing clicks. She doesn’t remember crafting any of it.

"This Apartment Smells Like Memories"
— Nerthus explores the apartment. Everything whispers of the life she forgot… especially the locked baby room.

"Migraine"
— Nerthus collapses while attempting glass art. Skadii rushes home. Her voice shakes as she asks him, “Why do you care so much?”

"Because I Promised"
— Skadii takes her to the aquarium to calm her down. He reminds her of the vow he made. Narwhals swim silently.

"Don't Treat Me Like I'm Her"
— Nerthus lashes out during dinner. She thinks Skadii is projecting the 'old' her onto this new version.

"Missing Pieces"
— Nerthus finds the stingray plush and starts questioning why her heart aches around Skadii.

"I Tried to Love You Again"
— Skadii confesses that he’s been falling in love with her again, day by day—even if it’s unreturned.

"I Left Because I Was Scared"
— Nerthus runs away one night. Skadii finds her crying at the aquarium. She admits she's terrified of forgetting again.

"Narwhals Don’t Forget"
— They reconcile in front of the narwhals. A kiss. A spark. Not of remembrance—but maybe of something new.

"Please… Just Let Me Keep Him"
— In a dream, Nerthus whispers this as lights flicker like fading memories. She wakes up. Her hand is holding his.
