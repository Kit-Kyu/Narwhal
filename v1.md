Volume 1 – Before the Loss

“A Glass Half Full”
  Skadii wakes up first again, brewing coffee for a wife who never asks for it.

“The Stingray by the Door”
  A locked nursery, a plush toy, and a question Nerthus never answers.

“Time-Outs and Take-Outs”
  Chere visits, chaos ensues, Nerthus pretends not to care, and Skadii burns dinner again.

“Cold Hands, Warm Lies”
  Nerthus recoils from his touch but clings to his presence.

“Where the Narwhals Swim”
  They go to the aquarium together. She doesn’t hold his hand, but she doesn’t let go either.

“Forget-Me-Nots Don’t Bloom in Winter”
  Nerthus forgets a date. Skadii says it’s fine. It's not.

“The Girl with the Glass Heart”
  Nerthus makes a Narwhal Glass statue and a familiar 16 year old girl says its lonely.

“Static on the Line”
  They argue. Skadii says he’s not tired. Nerthus says she never asked.

“Don't Look at Me Like That”
  Skadii finds her list of glass commissions. One is left unfinished. It’s a narwhal.

“The Quiet Before the Cut”
  The night before surgery. She lays beside him, pretending to sleep. He pretends not to cry.
